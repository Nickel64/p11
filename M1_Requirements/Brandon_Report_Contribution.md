## 3.3 Usability Requirements
The usability of the final product should meet both the requirements & objectives expected of the client but also the usability needs of all stakeholders. Theses usability requirements & objectives can be splits up into three different criteria measurable effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction criteria based in context of use of bus factor software program.
### Measurable effectiveness
The quality of the software program while being used from the stakeholder perspective can be defined on how effective the software program is at performing it’s intended task.  Hence for the bus factor project to meet usability requirements & objectives the product it will need to preform it’s intended task effectively. 
*	Required at least a 90% accuracy detection rate on buses passing red lights. If the product didn’t have good level of accuracy the product would appear broken or unusable from a stakeholder perspective. Accuracy requirements will also apply end goal of detection of buses occurring with undefined hardware, intersections and angles. 
*	Number plate letter digitalization will be required to have 95% confidence that digitalization is correct else the software program should refuse to produce a letter sequence of the plate. The confidence requirement stops false reports of number plates that didn’t skip red lights. If false reports of number plates would occur frequently stakeholder’s confidence in the accuracy of the software would reduce significantly.
*	Video moments generation of when buses cross reds light required to have 90% accuracy of generating video clips of bus that crossed the red light. If video clips didn’t include the correct bus the software product would appear buggy to stakeholders.
