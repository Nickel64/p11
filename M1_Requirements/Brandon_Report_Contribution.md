## 3.3 Usability Requirements
The usability of the final product should meet both the requirements & objectives expected of the client but also the usability needs of all stakeholders. Theses usability requirements & objectives can be splits up into three different criteria measurable effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction criteria based in the context of use of bus factor software program.

### Measurable Effectiveness
The quality of the software program while being used from the stakeholder perspective defined as how effective the software program is at performing it’s intended task.  Hence for the bus factor project to meet usability requirements & objectives the product, it will need to perform it’s intended task effectively. 
*	Required at least a 90% accuracy detection rate on buses passing red lights. If the product didn’t have a good level of accuracy, the product would appear broken or unusable from a stakeholder perspective. Accuracy requirements will also apply end goal of detection of buses occurring with undefined hardware, intersections, and angles. 
*	Number plate letter digitalization will be required to have 95% confidence that digitalization is correct else the software program should refuse to produce a letter sequence of the plate. The confidence requirement stops false reports of number plates that didn’t skip red lights. If false reports of number plates would frequently occur, stakeholder’s confidence in the accuracy of the software would reduce significantly.
*	Video moments generation of when buses cross reds light required to have 90% accuracy of generating video clips of the bus that crossed the red light. If video clips didn’t include the correct bus, the software product would appear buggy to stakeholders. 

### Efficiency
How efficient the software program is performing the task of detecting buses running reds lights will affect the stakeholder’s opinion on the usability of the software product. The efficiency of the software program defined on how well the software uses its hardware resources and how quickly software calculations take.
*	All user input is required to have response time 0.1 seconds ensuring the software program appears to be reacting instantaneously; this includes all background calculations necessary to generate some form of response. If response takes longer than 0.1 seconds with user input, the software program will feel clunky to stakeholders.
*	The bus factor software program objectively should not be using more than 20 percent CPU and will be required to feel more of a passive user of the CPU and not the main user. If the software program is an excessive percentage of the CPU and felt like the main user of the CPU, it would make the software product feel badly designed and not fit for use.
*	Flagging of buses passing red lights are required to be no longer than 0.5 seconds. If the flagging process takes longer the software product will feel inaccurate and performing its task effectively to stakeholders. 

### Satisfaction
Satisfaction of the user will be using the software product will be defined based on their experience with the software product which directly affects the usability of the software product to the stakeholder. For the user to be satisfied with the product, it must perform detection of buses running red lights as expected by the user and be pleased with the experience of getting the product doing the detection task. 
*	Required at most five mouse button presses for installing the software product. While most users will have some technical background, the experience of using the product should be easy. If the process of installation was too long, it could result in stakeholders not bothering to use the software product at all. 
*	Required that any form of necessary input with the product while the software product is running is self-intuitive, this would include configuration input such defining areas of where the traffics lights will be. If the input system is found unintuitive by stakeholders, the satisfaction of stakeholders will be affected reducing the usability of the software product.
*	User-defined code system will be required to take no longer than ten mins to understand for average programmer ensuring that user-defined code system will be useable to an average programmer. If the user-defined code system took too long to understand due to the complexity the experience for the programmer would be negatively affecting their satisfaction with the software product hence reducing the usability.
