ENGR 301 Project *11* Project Proposal and Requirements Document
#### Brandon Scott-Hill, Dylan Kumar, James Magallanes, Kristen Tait, Nicholas Snellgrove, Sean Stevenson

## 1. Introduction
One page overall introduction including sections 1.1 and 1.2.

### Client

Identify the client and their contact details

### 1.1 Purpose

One sentence describing the purpose of the system (9.5.1)

### 1.2 Scope

One paragraph describing the scope of the system (9.5.2)

### 1.3 Product overview 
#### 1.3.1 Product perspective

One page defining the system's relationship to other related products
(9.5.3. but not the subsections in the standard.)

#### 1.3.2 Product functions

One page summary of the main functions of the product (9.5.4),
briefly characterising the minimum viable product.

#### 1.3.3 User characteristics   

One page identifying the main classes of users and their
characteristics (9.5.5) 

#### 1.3.4 Limitations

One page on the limitations on the product (9.5.6)

## 2. References

References to other documents or standards. Follow the IEEE Citation Reference scheme, available from the [IEEE website](https://www.ieee.org/documents/ieeecitationref.pdf) (PDF; 451 KB).
(1 page, longer if required)

## 3. Specific requirements  

20 pages outlining the requirements of the system.
You should apportion these these pages across the following 
subsections to focus on the most important parts of your product.

### 3.1 External interfaces

See 9.5.10. for most systems this will be around one page.

### 3.2 Functions

This is typically the longest subsection in the document - see 9.5.11.
List up to fifty use cases (in order of priority for development), and
for at least top ten focal use cases, write a short goal statement and
use case body (up to seven pages).  Identify the use cases that
comprise a minimum viable product.

### 3.3 Usability Requirements

See 9.5.12. for most systems this will be around one page.

### 3.4 Performance requirements

See 9.5.13. for most systems this will be around one page.
Hardware projects also see section 9.4.6.


### 3.5 Logical database requirements

See 9.5.14. for most systems, a focus on d) and e) is appropriate,
such as an object-oriented domain analysis. You should provide an
overview domain model (e.g.  a UML class diagram of approximately ten
classes) and write a brief description of the responsibilities of each
class in the model (3 pages).

### 3.6 Design constraints

see 9.5.15 and 9.5.16. for most systems, this will be around one page.

### 3.7 Software system attributes

Present the systemic (aka non-functional) requirements of the product
(see ISO/IEC 25010).
List up to twenty systemic requirements / attributes.
Write a short natural language description of the top nonfunctional
requirements (approx. five pages).


### 3.8 Physical and Environmental Requirements 

For systems with hardware components, identify the physical
characteristics of that hardware (9.4.10) and environment conditions
in which it must operate (9.4.11).  Depending on the project, this
section may be from one page up to 5 pages.

### 3.10 Supporting information

see 9.5.19. 

## 4. Verification

5 pages outlining how you will verify that the product meets the
most important specific requirements. The format of this section
should parallel section 3 of your document (see 9.5.18).
Wherever possible (especially systemic requirements) you should
indicate testable acceptance criteria.

## 5. Development schedule.

### 5.1 Schedule

Identify dates for key project deliverables: 
1. architectural prototype
1. minimum viable product
1. further releases

(1 page).

### 5.2 Budget

Present a budget for the project (table), and justify each budget item
(one paragraph per item, one page overall). 

### 5.3 Risks 

Identify the ten most important project risks: their type, likelihood,
impact, and mitigation strategies (3 pages).


## 6. Appendices
### 6.1 Assumptions and dependencies 

one page on assumptions and dependencies (9.5.7) 

### 6.2 Acronyms and abbreviations

* Incident: Refers to a bus being observed running a red light, as captured by the software.
