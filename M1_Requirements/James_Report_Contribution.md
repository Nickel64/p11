## Product Overview
### 1.3.1 Product Perspective

There have been multiple studies done on vehicles running red lights at intersections, with algorithms being created to detect whether a vehicle will run a red light, with accuracy over 90%. The Bus Factor project product can relate to systems currently in place in multiple countries – for example the United States of America and India – where there are cameras stationed to catch motorists running red lights. While the Bus Factor product is not going to be developed for commercial or government use, such as traffic enforcement, the project still holds similar requirements that it needs to detect the traffic light state and vehicles' positions in relation to the intersection/crossing.

The product is being produced for a podcast called The Bus Factor that incorporates a live stream video showing the intersection outside of the office building the hosts are situated. The angle that the camera is positioned at contrasts with the position the traffic cameras in countries around the world are – those of which the angle has been optimised for the detection and image capture of the vehicles travelling through the intersection. The way the camera used in the Bus Factor project is currently situated, the traffic light state is not easy to see – so the accuracy of the light and vehicle detection is unideal to be implemented on by image processing techniques. 

This lacklustre setup poorly compares to the commercial/governmental uses in countries around the world 


and the ability to predict dangerous events occurring seconds in advance. 

In terms of our specific project - making for bus factor stream/podcast



### 1.3.2 Product Functions

The basic functionality for this product, as described by our Minimum Viable Product (MVP), is as follows:

1. The ability to detect the traffic light state and buses travelling through the video feed from a consumer webcam
2. Functionality for a User Interface so that a user can define areas of interest. Specified areas of interest include:
    - The bounding box of the traffic light and individual bounding boxes of each traffic light colour
    - The stopping line at the intersection for the system to detect when the bus passes over it

3. The ability to output a static image that has been created once the system detects a traffic violation by bus 
4. That the system works on a Windows operating system. 

A consumer webcam is defined as a readily available camera that one may commonly find in-built in laptops or as an external USB camera.
