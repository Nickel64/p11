# Project Proposal and Requirements Document

The aim of the project proposal and requirements document is to
capture the requirements for the software your group is to build. It
should communicate clearly to the supervisor, client and course
coordinator exactly what the software you build is going to do, and
what constraints it must meet while doing so.

The document should also demonstrate your understanding of the main
analysis principles and quality guidelines, using tools and associated
notations as necessary to communicate the requirements precisely,
unambiguously and clearly in a written technical document. Page specifications below are *limits not targets* and refer to the pages in the PDF generated from the markdown. Because the size of your document is necessarily limited, you should ensure
that you focus your efforts on those requirements that are most
important to completing a successful system: if sections are at their
page limit, indicate how many would items be expected in a complete
specification. 

The ENGR 301 project proposal and requirements document should be based
on the standard ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2011(E), primarily sections 8.4 and
9.5, plus section 9.4 for projects involving hardware and ISO 25010
SQuaRE for systemic requirements. The proposal and requirements
document should contain the sections listed below, and conform to the
formatting rules listed at the end of this brief. 

### 3.2 Functions

This is typically the longest subsection in the document - see 9.5.11.
List up to fifty use cases (in order of priority for development), and
for at least top ten focal use cases, write a short goal statement and
use case body (up to seven pages).  Identify the use cases that
comprise a minimum viable product.

Plug in webcam and software renders
Select area for traffic lights
Select area for bus detection


MVP: 
    * Video input from consumer webcam using angle from Podcast
    * User input for detecting intersection, define light with circle, define bus with a line that is crossed w/ User interface
    * Output static image of moment offending occurs
    * Works on windows
Priority list:
## END GOAL
    * Consumer webcam and hardware, any intersection, any angle
    * Plug in webcam, run program and auto detects intersection elements
    * Output video of moment offending occurs
    * User defined code when event occurs
    * Works on Linux
    
### EXTRAS
    * License plate detection
    * Events of interest
        * Police intervention
        * Bus collisions w/ Pedestrians
        * Near Misses
    * OBS Integration
    * Prediction/statistics based on time, weather etc
    * Detecting different kinds of busses, other vehicles
        * Reporting statistics of event to parent company (Or Traffic authority)
        * could use licence plate detection
    * Speed Detection
