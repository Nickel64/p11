1. Autodetect location of buses, lights, turning direction, number plate, speed, lanes/multilanes. Work on bad cameras. All in real time. 
Detect likelyhood of bus running red light/hitting somebody. Detecting person walking (pedestrian in danger detection). Timestamps and basic analytics data of as it runs the red light.


2. Work out the colours of the lights. Detect whether the vehicle is a bus and whether it runs the detected light colour. 

 The classifier needed to output whether there was a traffic light in the scene, and whether it was red or green (or yellow ?). 

 More specifically, it should only identify traffic lights in the driving direction.

3. Interface where you select the area of traffic lights (rectangle/circle selection tool where you check the colour of pixels to Red, Yellow, Green). OR if there is no traffic light?



Note: Financial: we need computing power that is fast enough to run enough (or processing power of language not fast enough.)
What framerate do we do machine learning on (checking x amount of frames per second to save computing power).

What open source licence should we use?

front end app?
